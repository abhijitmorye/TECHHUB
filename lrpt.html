        <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Introduction and Architecture of Loadrunner</h3>
        <p>LOADRUNNER is a Performance Testing tool which was pioneered by Mercury in 1999. LoadRunner was later acquired by HPE in 2006. In 2016, Loadrunner was acquired by MicroFocus.</p>
        <p>LoadRunner supports various development tools, technologies and communication protocols. In fact, this is the only tool in market which supports such a large number of protocols to conduct Performance Testing. Performance Test Results produced by Loadrunner are used as a benchmark against other tools</p>

            <strong>VUGEN :</strong>
            <p>VUGen or Virtual User Generator is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a rich coding editor. VUGen is used to replicate System Under Load (SUL) behavior. VUGen provides a "recording" feature which records communication to and from client and Server in form of a coded script - also called VUser script.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Controller :</strong>
            <p>Once a VUser script is finalized, Controller is the main component which controls the Load simulation by managing, for example:</p>
            <ul type="square">
              <li>How many VUsers to simulate against each business process or VUser Group</li>
              <li>Behavior of VUsers (ramp up, ramp down, simultaneous or concurrent nature etc.)</li>
              <li>Nature of Load scenario e.g. Real Life or Goal Oriented or verifying SLA</li>
              <li>Which injectors to use, how many VUsers against each injector</li>
              <li>Collate results periodically</li>
              <li>IP Spoofing</li>
              <li>Error reporting</li>
              <li>Transaction reporting etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <strong>Load Injectors/Generators</strong>
            <p>LoadRunner Controller is responsible to simulate thousands of VUsers - these VUsers consume hardware resources for example processor and memory - hence putting a limit on the machine which is simulating them. Besides, Controller simulates these VUsers from the same machine (where Controller resides) & hence the results may not be precise. To address this concern, all VUsers are spread across various machines, called <strong>Load Generators or Load Injectors</strong>.</p>
            <p>As a general practice, Controller resides on a different machine and load is simulated from other machines. Depending upon the protocol of VUser scripts and machine specifications, a number of Load Injectors may be required for full simulation. For example, VUsers for an HTTP script will require 2-4MB per VUser for simulation, hence 4 machines with 4 GB RAM each will be required to simulate a load of 10,000 VUsers.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analysis :</strong>
          </li>
          <p>Once the test is finishes,Loadrunner analyzer will provide the different graphs baed on result.</p>
          <p>During the execution, Controller creates a dump of results in raw form & contains information like, which version of LoadRunner created this results dump and what were configurations.</p>
          <p>All the errors and exceptions are logged in a Microsoft access database, named, <strong>output.mdb</strong>. The "Analysis" component reads this database file to perform various types of analysis and generates graphs.</p>
          <p>These graphs show various trends to understand the reasoning behind errors and failure under load; thus help to figure whether optimization is required in SUL, Server (e.g. JBoss, Oracle) or infrastructure.</p>
